## Worley biomes
<img src="worley_preview.png" width="500" />
A worley noise implementation, that supports k-nearest sampling + biome classification. 

The library comes with a bevy, DebugPlugin that can visualize the worley as a texture + live tweak.

### compilation flag features
"serde", "bevy"

### in-depth my design decisions
This library uses a [further developed version](https://github.com/TanTanDev/bracket-fast-noise/tree/main) of 
[bracket-noise](https://crates.io/crates/bracket-noise).
The reason I don't fork bracket is because bracket-fast-nosie is a sub crate inside a collection of libraries.  
My version implement serialization+deserialization with serde.
I haven't done performance comparisons with other libraries, it does the job well, and I like the api.
